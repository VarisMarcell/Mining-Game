# Mining-Game
I wanted to get some practice with Vue.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express while applying optimized algorithms and learning industry workflow.

This is a browser game where a player can mine different types of ore nodes with various tools and then sell them to purchase improved tools.

## MVP
- Players find various ores.
- Players mine ores using tools (with different properties/effects)
- Mining gives randomized rewards, affected by modifiers.
- Players can sell ores for currency.
- Players can buy loot crates to get new mining tools.
- Players have an inventory system which can be opened using 'tab'
- Game has simple but attractive UI for players to navigate through.

## Extra Tasks
- Add a database to save player information
- Add a shop + shop UI
- Add a crafting system where players can use their ores to craft better tools
- Add multiplayer support.
